Attendeft is a powerful attendance management software cooked primarily to counter the frustration of school teachers in handling the attendance in online classes. Built with pure Python, AttenDeft thanks modules os, pickle, tkinter, subprocess, platform, csv, shutil, calendar, datetime and 3rd party packages auto-py-to-exe, pyinstaller, xlsxwriter and openpyxl for essential contributions. The whole software is created on sublime text IDE, which works akin to its name. This software is a candid attempt towards making online teaching a cakewalk.
