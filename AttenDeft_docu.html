	<p>
		<b>Attendeft</b> is a powerful attendance management software cooked primarily to counter the frustration of school teachers in handling the attendance in online classes. Built with pure Python, AttenDeft thanks modules<b> os, pickle, tkinter, subprocess, platform, csv, shutil, calendar, datetime</b> and 3rd party packages <b>auto-py-to-exe, pyinstaller, xlsxwriter</b> and <b>openpyxl</b> for essential contributions. The whole software is created on <b>sublime text IDE</b>, which works akin to its name. This software is a candid attempt towards making online teaching a cakewalk. 
		With AttenDeft in your E-Teaching kitty, online classes will start becoming smooth.<br><br></p>
